Like a recurrent boltzmann neuralnet except every possible lambda function is a node and has 1 weight and 1 bit. The set of all possible sets of lambda functions where forall lambda x in set, forall lambda y in set, forall lambda z in set, (λa.λb.λc.a(λm.λn.n)bc)xyz does not halt. This space will be sparsely navigated approximately using an energy function.
